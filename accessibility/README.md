# Accessibility

It is essential that the content we create is accessible and usable for the widest possible audience.
This includes users of all mental and physical capabilities.  We must always consider accessibility
standards when editing and creating content, from the words we choose to the way our content is
organized.

Here are a list of resources on the topic of accessibility. Some are directly related to writing and
communication, others more loosely connected about web development and design.
