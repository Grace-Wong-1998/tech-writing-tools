# Accessibility

The content we create must be accessible and usable for the widest possible audience. This
includes users of all mental and physical capabilities. We must always consider standards for
accessibility and inclusion when editing and creating content, from the words we choose to
the way our content is organized.

I've written an [accessibility style guide](style.md) which outlines some best practcies.
Feel free to copy this document in whole and add it to your company style guide.
