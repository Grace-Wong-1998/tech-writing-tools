# Guide to using fewer words

When writing technical documentation, you should be clear and concise. Here are some helpful tips to write your docs:

1. Use active voice. Emphasize the subject that is acting, rather than the action they are taking.
- **DO**: The product handles all billing for users.
- **DON'T**: All billings for users are handled by the product.

2. Be specific.
- **DO**: Run a linter to verify there are no bugs.
- **DON'T**: Check to see if there are bugs by running the debugging linter.

3. Remove adverbs.
- **DO**: Do not change the name of this class.
- **DON'T**: It's likely that changing the name of this class will break your code.

4. Don't repeat yourself.
- **DO**: For additional help, contact customer support.
- **DON'T**: If you have a problem that cannot be solved with documentation, you can contact our customer support.

5. Remove filler words. For example: "basically," "rather," "just," "as a matter of fact," "at all times."
- **DO**: Edit the content directly in your WYSIWYG.
- **DON'T**: Actually, it's best that you just edit the content in the WYSIWYG.

6. Remove double subjects.
- **DO**: This line of CSS defines how to style a title element.
- **DON'T**: This line of CSS is the line which defines how to style a title element.
