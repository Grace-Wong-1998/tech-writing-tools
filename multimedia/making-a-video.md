## Livestreaming and green screen production
If you're livestreaming or using a green screen, consider the following.

### What information do you need for a livestream production?

+ Date and time of the presentation
+ Title of the presentation
+ On-screen talent name and title for lower thirds
+ Any graphics/product demos to be reviewed before the event
+ End title card

### What should I be wearing?

A solid color button down or polo-type shirt. Avoid wearing the following:
+ Green shirts (as you will be filmed in front of a green screen)
+ Plaid, checked, tightly patterned or striped shirts
+ Graphic Tee shirts

## General best practices

### Audio

+ Be aware of unwanted noises. If you have an air conditioner running, a fan, or noisy neighbors, this may all be picked up. If you record in a room with a window to a noisy street, this will be picked up.
+ Before your first take, or as the very last take, record a :30 clip of room tone, where everyone is as quiet as they possibly can be. This will give you a great sample of room tone to remove during post.
+ Invest in a [quality microphone](/multimedia#other-tools)
