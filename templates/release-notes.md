# What's new for <project_name>

*Note*: If possible, group release notes into larger buckets.

Example structures:

+ You can nowâ€¦
   + You can now target specific time ranges with DateTimeRangeTargeting.
+ X now does Y / X no longer does Y.
   + Phone numbers are no longer supported in any version of the Google Pay API.
+ X no longer does Y. This means you no longer need to do Z.
   + Field classification can now detect four-digit numbers as the last four digits of a credit card number. This means you no longer need to match that data to an existing string.

## Coming soon

Include any release notes that are coming soon.
