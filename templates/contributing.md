# Contributing to <project_name>

Write something nice and instructive as an intro. Talk about what kind of contributions you are interested in.

If you're not looking for specific contributions, note that up front. For example:

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Instead use: a, b, or Stack Overflow.

## Code of Conduct

If you have a code of conduct (CoC) document, include the expectation and link to the document. For example:

> By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. We expect all contributors to follow the Code of Conduct and to treat fellow humans with respect.

If there's not a separate document, include your CoC here.

## Additional resources

Include links to additional resources, such as docs, bugs, and communication venues (developer listserv, emails, etc).

## Request a feature

Provide information on the process for requsting new features. Do you have a specific label that should be applied? Is sign-off needed?

Share roadmap, goals, or development philosophies.

## Reporting bugs

**If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email `<EMAIL@DOMAIN.COM>` instead.**

Ask contributors to run a bug check before submitting any changes. Also ask them to read any existing bugs to ensure they're not creating duplicates.

Link to FAQs or debugging guides.

## Improving documentation

Include notes for how users can improve the documentation.

> Should you have a suggestion for the documentation, you can open an issue and outline the problem or improvement you have - however, creating the doc fix yourself is much better!

> If you want to help improve the docs, it's a good idea to let others know what you're working on to minimize duplication of effort. Create a new issue (or comment on a related existing one) to let others know what you're working on. If you're making a small change (typo, phrasing) don't worry about filing an issue first.

Provide instructions on buildling and viewing documentation
